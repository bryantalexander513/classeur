# Classeur frontend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/classeur/classeur.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/classeur/classeur)

This is the frontend application as used in [Classeur](https://app.classeur.io).

This application was made possible thanks to these libraries:

- [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
- [Markdown It](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)
- [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism)

The [cledit library](https://github.com/classeur/cledit) developed by the Classeur team is also an important part of the project.
